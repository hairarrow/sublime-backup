Thank you for your installing.

=====Supported Platforms=====
We support all platforms 'osx', 'linux' and 'windows' on ST3,
but ST2, 'osx' and 'linux' only.
sorry.

=====How to use=====
Now, you are cording with sounds.
Default, we plays sound when...

+ any key was pressed (modify)
+ new file was created
+ file was opened
+ file was saved
+ file was closed
+ file was duplicated (File menu > New view into File)

=====Custom Sounds (Mute)=====
You can customize all default sounds by replace files on
Sublime Preferences > Package Settings > Sound > Replace sounds
(only supports wav file).

If you puts some files in directory, we play these files randomly (See on_modify directory),
and when delete all files, we play none (mute).
